### Introduction (Business Problem) ###
* Leverage the accident data to predict the different accidents' severity based on a spectrum of variables such as the location, type of road, junction type, weather, and vehicle conditions
* The question that needs to be addressed is how to classify a new record in the data set as 1 or 2 in severity code based on the above mentioned variables?
* This problem will use machine learning techniques such as classification
The ML algofirthms will be trained in using Python in built libraries

### Discussion of the background ###

* The audience of the analysis and evaluation is traffic police of different regions and the question it will help address is how they can avoid future accidents
* Additional use cases could be using KPIs for awareness campaigns for the people to know about the key reasons for an accident and the ways to avoid it
* The Traffic PD would be keen to see the outputs of this project as it would help them reduce fatalities overall by deploying mitigation strategies for the various type of accidents based on their severity. This would otherwise would be hidden and no meaningful insight could be derived from it
